Theorem 1.28 In an acyclic directed graph D there exists at least one vertex with zero
indegree and at least one vertex with zero outdegree. 
Select any vertex with zero outdegree. Since D is acyclic, by Theorem 1.28, there is at least
one such vertex in D. Label this vertex with the integer n. Now remove from D this vertex
and the edges incident on it. Let D′ be the resulting graph. Since D′
is also acyclic, we can
now select a vertex whose outdegree in D′
is zero. Label this with the integer n − 1. Repeat
this procedure until all the vertices are labeled. It is now easy to verify that this procedure
results in a topological sorting of the vertices of D.
