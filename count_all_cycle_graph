When you are doing DFS or BFS traversal on any graph then the basic fact that you need to remember is that
the algorithm guarantees only to visit all the reachable nodes from the source node only once

it does not guarantee to visit all paths present in the graph

While solving problems on finding if ther is any cycle in the grpah present 
I wanted to also count the total no of cycles present in the grpah  

after thinking for some time I realized that these two traversal mechanism are not going to help you traverse all the possible paths 
present in the graph.

it only guarantees that all the reachable nodes will be visited once.

So i am still wondering how to find all the unique paths to reach from start node to all other nodes in a graph

what would be the time complexity of that algorithm and all
